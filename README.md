# ML-isolet
Machine Learning Algorithms applied to data from recordings of individuals pronouncing each letter of the English alphabet using glmnet, randomForests, xgboost


Core machine learning concepts such as: 
* choosing loss functions and evaluation metrics
* splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets
* cross-validation patterns for tuning hyper-parameters. 


Apply ML Algorithms:
* elastic net (a generalization of ridge and lasso regression) [glmnet]
* random forests [randomForests]
* gradient boosting [xgboost]
