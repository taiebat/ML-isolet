# ML-isolet
Machine Learning Algorithms applied to data from recordings of individuals pronouncing each letter of the English alphabet


Core machine learning concepts such as: choosing loss functions and evaluation metrics; splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets; and cross-validation patterns for tuning hyper-parameters. Next, we’ll apply these concepts to train models for identifying isolated letters from speech (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/isolet).

apply the elastic net (a generalization of ridge and lasso regression), random forests, and gradient boosting to this task. We’ll briefly discuss each model/method but our primary focus will be on understanding the core functionality of the related R packages (glmnet, randomForests, xgboost) and tuning associated hyper-parameters.
